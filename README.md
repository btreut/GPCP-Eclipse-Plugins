# GPCP-Eclipse-Plugins

These plugins were provided by Queensland University of Technology (QUT), see  https://web.archive.org/web/20110218033418/http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/gpcp/IDE.aspx and may be used with the JVM version of Gardens Point Component Pascal (GPCP). Hopefully they can be made to work with the current versions of GPCP and Eclipse. I rediscovered them on my shelf on 1. March 2022, created this repo, and uploaded them.
